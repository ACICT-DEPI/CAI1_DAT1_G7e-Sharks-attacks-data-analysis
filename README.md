Shark Attack Data Analysis Project
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of global shark attack data, aiming to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that can inform public safety measures and mitigation strategies.

Project Description
The Shark Attack Data Analysis project was conducted to analyze and visualize shark attack data from various sources, including the International Shark Attack File (ISAF) and the Global Shark Attack File (GSAF). The analysis aimed to:

Identify geographical hotspots for shark attacks
Analyze the temporal and spatial patterns of shark attacks
Investigate the relationship between shark attacks and human activities (e.g., surfing, swimming)
Develop predictive models to forecast shark attack risk
Methodology
The analysis was conducted using a combination of data cleaning, feature engineering, and data visualization techniques. The following tools and libraries were used:

Microsoft Excel: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Power Query: For data cleaning, transformation, and loading.
Power Pivot: For data modeling and analysis.
Power BI: For data visualization and reporting.
The methodology consisted of the following steps:

Data Collection: We collected shark attack data from various sources, including the International Shark Attack File (ISAF) and the Global Shark Attack File (GSAF).
Data Cleaning: We used Power Query to clean and transform the data, handling missing values, data inconsistencies, and data formatting issues.
Data Analysis: We used Excel to analyze the data, creating pivot tables, charts, and other visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
Data Modeling: We used Power Pivot to create a data model, defining relationships between tables and creating calculations to support our analysis.
Data Visualization: We used Power BI to create interactive and dynamic visualizations, including maps, charts, and tables, to communicate our findings.
Insight Generation: We used the insights generated from our analysis to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in shark attack data, and to develop recommendations for mitigating shark attack risk.
Key Findings
The analysis revealed several key findings, including:

Geographical hotspots for shark attacks are concentrated in coastal regions with high population density and recreational activities
Shark attacks are more common during afternoon hours and in areas with bait fish presence
Human activities such as surfing and swimming are associated with increased shark attack risk
Predictive models can be developed to forecast shark attack risk based on historical data and environmental factors
